 Computer Architecture university study subject assignments (“Turing Parallel Simulator”, “Assembler & SSE Parallel Pythagorean Number Calculation”, “Simple Virtual Machine”, “CP437 to UTF-8 Converter”, “Bitwise XOR without XOR”).

## Assignment 1. Turing Parallel Simulator
A Turing simulator written in C++ that can run multiple Turing code files in parallel with visualization. Capable of detecting infinite loops during run-time.

## Assignment 2. Assembler & SSE Parallel Pythagorean Number Calculation
An inline assembly application that finds all Pythagorean numbers and checks several of them at the same time by utilizing SSE instructions, the output is provided in CSV format. Another assembler application converts a given string to an integer.


## Assignment 3. Simple Virtual Machine
A VM written in C++ that runs a provided custom binary file with VM specific execution codes and commands to encode/decode given text.
